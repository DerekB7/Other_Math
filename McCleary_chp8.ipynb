But the co-domain of $\\hat f$ is $S_1$ which doesn't contain $x$, a contradiction. (Formally it is problematic to talk about the winding number for $y$ not in the Co-domain so running the argument instead as $g:= i\\circ \\hat f$ hence $g:D^2\\longrightarrow D^2$ with the same image as $\\hat f$ is a cleaner argument.)   \n",
